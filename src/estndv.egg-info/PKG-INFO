### Learned NDV estimator
Learned model to estimate number of distinct values (NDV) of a population using a small sample. The model approximates the maximum likelihood estimation of NDV, which is difficult to obtain analytically.
See our VLDB 2022 paper [Learning to be a Statistician: Learned Estimator for Number of Distinct Values](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p272-wu.pdf) for more details.

### How to use
1. Install the package
   
    `pip install estndv`

2. Import and create an instance

```python
   from estndv import ndvEstimator
   estimator = ndvEstimator()
```

4. Assume your sample is S=[1,1,1,3,5,5,12] and the population size is N=100000. You can estimate population ndv by:

    `ndv = estimator.sample_predict(S=[1,1,1,3,5,5,12], N=100000)`
   
5. If you have the sample profile e.g. f=[2,1,1], you can estimate population NDV by:
   
    `ndv = estimator.profile_predict(f=[2,1,1], N=100000)`

6. If you have multiple samples/profiles from multiple populations, you can estimate population NDV for all of them in a batch by method `estimator.sample_predict_batch()` or `estimator.profile_predict_batch()`.



### How to train the ndv estimator
You can directly use our package on PyPI for your datasets, as the pre-trained model is agnostic to any workloads. However, if you want to train the model from scratch anyway, do the following:
1. Go to the model_training folder
    `cd model_training`

2. Install requirements
   
    `pip install requirements.txt`
   
3. Generate training data. (This uses a lot of memory.)
   
    `python training_data_generation.py`
   
4. Train model
   
    `python model_training.py`
5. Save trained pytorch model parameters to numpy, this generates a file model_paras.npy

    `python torch2npy.py`

6. Test with your model parameters by specifying a path to your model_paras.npy

   `estimator = ndvEstimator(para_path=your path to model_paras.npy)`
